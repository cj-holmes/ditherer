# ditherer

The goal of ditherer is to implement a form of ordered imaging dithering.

This is a very early work in progress.

## Installation
```{r eval = F}
remotes::install_github('cj-holmes/ditherer)
```

## Example

```{r}
library(ditherer)
library(ggplot2)
```

Test image from [The USC-SIPI Image Database](http://sipi.usc.edu/database/)
```{r example1, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
img <- 'data-raw/sailboat-on-lake.png'
patchwork::wrap_plots(dither(img, dither = FALSE, original = TRUE) + labs(title = "Original (resized)"),
                      dither(img, seed = 1) + labs(title = "Dithered - 6 colour target palette"))
```


```{r example2, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
dither(img, target_palette = "greyscale") + labs(title = "Dithered - 6 shades of grey")
```
